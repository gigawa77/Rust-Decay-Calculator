Press CTRL + SHIFT + J on your browser to open the console

Paste the code into your console and hit enter and you'll receive a prompt asking you for the material of the wall, enter either wood, stone, metal or armored, a 2nd prompt will then appear asking you to enter the HP of the wall, enter a whole number not something like '1000HP' or '850/2000'

The console will tell you how many minutes until the wall decays
